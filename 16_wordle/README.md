# Wordle

This time, there are no code instructions, just general overview.

You'll have to come up with the code organisation and ask the questions to
guide you.

## Hints

- https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list/blob/main/words

- E.g. display:

    ```shell
    1 > T E S T A
          游릳
    2 > P L A N T
        游릳
    3 > H U M I D
    4 > S C O R E
          游릳    游릴
    5 > C R E P E
        游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴

    You won!
    ```

## Stretch goals

For after you are done! And only if you want to make the display even fancier.
Look at how to update a line on the terminal, and add background color to some
letters. Ask for help if/when you're there.
